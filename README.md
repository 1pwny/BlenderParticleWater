# BlenderParticleWater

Simulating particle-based fluids using Blender. Created in the summer of 2018 by Sammy Berger, with guidance by Prof. Mridul Aanjaneya.

For detailed information concerning the project, goals, and methodoly, consult Paper.pdf; the definitive write-up for the project. As uploading the entirety of a Blender environment to github is quite space-intensive, I complied about 250 frames of the result simulation to result.gif.
